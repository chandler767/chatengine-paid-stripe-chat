# PubNub ChatEngine Paid Chat With Stripe

[![ChatEngine](https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine/blob/master/images/logo.png?raw=true)](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/socketio-chat-app-alternative/?devrel_gh=chatengine-paid-stripe-chat)

This project is based on [PubNub ChatEngine Basic Chat](https://github.com/ajb413/chatengine-basic-chat) with the addition of using Stripe to process a charge before allowing access to the chat.

**No need** for Socket.io, Mongo, Express, or Node.js server, both ChatEngine and Stripe charges work with **serverless** technology powered by **[PubNub Functions](https://www.pubnub.com/products/functions/)**.
